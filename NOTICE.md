Portions of the code found in the module.js file originate from [unsoluble's SmallTime](put-a-link-here) which is also licensed under MIT:
 - Lines 33 to 55 containing a function dealing with closing the FormApplication
 - Lines 76 as well as the idea to implement the [Draggabilly](https://draggabilly.desandro.com) library (MIT license) which makes it draggable
 - Lines 121 to 228 which control the experience of dragging the app around

The jiggle animation in the module.css file was also inspired by the one in the module above, but was heavily modified.

All other code is my own and is licensed as described in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
