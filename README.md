A beautiful mostly system-agnostic and completely customizable implementation of a Simultaneous Combat System. See the [Reddit post](https://redd.it/p11h35) from the author.

Have you ever tired of waiting for the turns of your friends to be over? Are you fed up with your players taking so long in *every* combat encounter? Do you feel like changing things up in your game and trying something new?

## Usage

Please follow the built-in tutorial (built with IntoJS), for instructions. You can always relaunch the tutorial from within the settings. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

## Features

### Action Locking

In supported systems, SCS will detect whether the current phase has been registered with the module and will restrict what can be done on your turn accordingly.

If you would like to add support for another system or more phases, please make a PR or let me know on my Discord (link is below) and I will happily take suggestions.

Currently only dnd5e is supported with the default phases as described in the reddit post linked above.

### Phase and Round display

The module will display the current phase and round in an interactive and draggable app. You can use the arrows to change phase (`<` or `>`) and change round (`<<` or `>>`), or you can simply click on the phase you would like to switch to (not recommended if using phase/cycle limits).

### Integration with the Core Combat Tracker

While this module hides the Combat Tracker by default, it updates it in the background whenever the round is switched to allow for better compatibility. There is also a setting to show the default Combat Tracker.

### Attack Roll HUD

In order to ease determining the attack order (for example, in the default attack phase), the module shows you the last attack roll in the token's HUD. This currently only works in D&D 5e and PF 2e.

### Integration with other modules

#### [SmallTime](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/smalltime)

The app moves outside of SmallTime's way and locks into place right above it.

#### [About Time](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/about-time)

If using About Time's realtime clock, SCS will prompt you to pause for the duration of your combat encounter. Just add a combatant (by right clicking on it and clicking "Toggle Combat State" in the HUD) and it will perceive that as a combat that has started. Removing all combatants ends the combat.

#### [Argon Combat HUD](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/enhancedcombathud)

This module hides Argon's "End Turn" button.

#### [Better Rolls 5e](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/betterrolls5e)

The HUD parses and handles Better Rolls' chat messages to allow it to display attack rolls made with the module.
Please note that SCS may have difficulty determining the correct token to add the HUD to if you use Better Rolls to roll for linked tokens. To get the right result, you can select the token before rolling for attack. If that doesn't work, make sure you only have one token from that Actor on the map.

If you are using Action Locking, you will get this warning from libWrapper which is safe to ignore:

```txt
libWrapper: Potential conflict detected between module 'scs' and module 'betterrolls5e'.
Module 'scs' did not chain the wrapper for 'CONFIG.Item.documentClass.prototype.roll'.
```

### Change Colors

Clicking this button will generate new random colors for the phases!

### Limit Phases

This setting will automatically switch the round at the end of the cycle of all phases. You can also do this with Maximum Cycle set to 1 and Limit Cycles enabled.

### Limit Cycles & Maximum Cycle

This setting will put a limit on how many cycles can take place before switching to the next round. For example, if Maximum Cycle is set to 3, after each phase has been completed three times, it will be the next round. It is recommended using the arrows to navigate between phases when using this.

## API

### Methods

SCS has a small API with a few methods that can be called by others. They are accessible under `game.modules.get("scs")?.api`.

#### `defaultTracker(hide = true)`

This will elegantly hide the default combat tracker from the sidebar. An optional Boolean parameter can be used to show the tracker again, if hidden.

#### `startTutorial()`

This will show the IntroJS tutorial tour once.

#### `stopTutorial(close = false)`

This will stop the tour from showing every time the page is loaded unless the user re-enabled the tutorial from within the module settings.
An optional Boolean parameter can be used to also immediately close the tutorial, but this defaults to `false`.

#### `changeRound(delta)`

An asynchronous method that changes the SCS's round by a given delta. Note that this will also change the Core round. Use a positive number for the delta to move the round forward and a negative number to go to previous rounds.

#### `changePhase(delta)`

An asynchronous method that changes the SCS's phase by a given delta. Use a positive number for the delta to move the round forward and a negative number to go to previous rounds.

### Hooks

This module has two hooks which are only called on the GM's client:

#### `scsRoundChanged`

This hook is called whenever the SCS round changes. It has three arguments which are (in order): the current phase, the previous phase, and the delta.

#### `scsPhaseChanged`

This hook is called whenever the SCS phase changes. It has three arguments which are (in order): the current phase, the previous phase, and the delta.

## Localization

Please note that the `Phases` must be short enough to fit their boxes, so you shouldn't put anything over approximately eight characters.
