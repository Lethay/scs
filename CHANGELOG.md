# Changelog

## 2.3.0 - 13 Aug 2021 - Cycles & Smooth scrolling

## 2.2.0 - 12 Aug 2021 - Stacks

## 0.4.2 - 25 Jun 2021 - Update loops

There was a super annoying bug where the app would go into an update loop which took like 10 hours to debug

## 0.4.1 - 24 Jun 2021 - For those without SmallTime

* Fixed a bug for anyone that doesn't have SmallTime installed

## 0.4.0 - 23 Jun 2021 - About Time for Gradients

Added integration with About Time, so that changing rounds updates the game's time. Currently, the time is not paused during combat as I still have to figure out how to do that.

Also, added some gradients to make it look nicer âœ¨
